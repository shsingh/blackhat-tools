The intent is to specifically learn writing asynchronous and/or concurrent software for security use-cases in:

- Typescript
- Go
- Rust
- Python

Any network-based tests are carried out against [scanme.f5labs.dev](https://scanme.f5labs.dev) which is a domain I own. Alternate domains include [scanme.nmap.org](http://scanme.nmap.org) if you do not own your own domain for testing.
